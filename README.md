# µfox

Make Firefox less visually intrusive.


#### Features
##### Findbar
µfox reduces the cognitive load of using the findbar by

1. Minimally styling it, eliminating buttons and using sane default options
2. taking it away from the bottom or top of the screen and bringing it closer to the rest of the content in the browser


##### Toolbar
µfox increases valuable screen real estate and minimizes visual interference by

1. Making the toolbar hidden when it is not focused
2. Making the toolbar minimally styled by
    - reducing movement, for example by eliminating borders that change color or expand
    - removing buttons which can have their features accessed by the URL bar


#### Warnings
µfox eliminates the tab bar completely. You **will** need an alternative. Try Tree Style Tab or Sideberry.


#### Suggestions
µfox pairs well with

1. Vimium
2. Tree Style Tab
