# `µfox`
Make Firefox less visually intrusive.


### Goals 📝
The overall goal of these styles is to eliminate some of Firefox's qualities that aren't useful to users who primarily use their keyboard to browse. The subgoals below discuss how.


#### Findbar
`Goal`: reduce the cognitive load of using the findbar by

1. taking it away from the edge of the screen and bringing it closer to the rest of the content in the browser
2. Minimally styling it, eliminating buttons and trying to use sane default options

#### Toolbar
`Goal`: increase valuable screen real estate and minimize visual interference by making the toolbar

1. hidden when it is not focused
    - `Protip`: to toggle focus on the Toolbar, use `f6`. `Ctrl+l` can only focus the toolbar, not unfocus it
2. minimally styled by
    - reducing movement, for example by eliminating borders that change color or expand
    - removing buttons which can have their features accessed by the URL bar

### Warnings ⚠️
`µfox` eliminates the tab bar completely. You **will** need an alternative. Try Tree Style Tab or Sideberry.
